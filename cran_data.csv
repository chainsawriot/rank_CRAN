The present version works with Cox regression ('coxph' class), linear models ('lm' class), generalized linear models ('glm' class), linear models fit by generalized least squares ('gls' class), linear mixed models ('lme' class), generalized linear mixed models ('mer' and 'merMod' classes), multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions ('multinom', 'polr', 'clm', and 'clmm' classes), robust regression models ('rlm' class), nonlinear models ('nls' class), and nonlinear mixed models ('nlme' class).  The package also supports various models incorporating detection probabilities such as single-season occupancy models ('unmarkedFitOccu' and 'unmarkedFitOccuFP classes), multiple-season occupancy models ('unmarkedFitColExt' class), single-season heterogeneity models ('unmarkedFitOccuRN' class), single-season and multiple-season N-mixture models for repeated counts ('unmarkedFitPCount' and 'unmarkedFitPCO' classes, respectively), and distance sampling models ('unmarkedFitDS' and 'unmarkedFitGDS' classes). Some functions also allow the creation of model selection tables for Bayesian models of the 'bugs' and 'rjags' classes.","methods, stats","lme4, MASS, Matrix, nlme, nnet, ordinal, R2jags, R2OpenBUGS, R2WinBUGS, stats4, survival, unmarked",,,1.35,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],

Quantitative liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics can measure relative protein abundance on a system-wide scale. To estimate absolute quantitative information using these relative abundance measurements requires additional information such as heavy-labeled references of known concentration. Multiple methods have been using different references and strategies; some are easily available whereas others require more effort on the users end. Hence, we believe the field might benefit from making some of these methods available under an automated framework, which also facilitates validation of the chosen strategy. We have implemented the most commonly used absolute label-free protein abundance estimation methods for LC-MS/MS modes quantifying on either MS1-, MS2-levels or spectral counts together with validation algorithms to enable automated data analysis and error estimation. Specifically, we used Monte-carlo cross-validation and bootstrapping for model selection and imputation of proteome-wide absolute protein quantity estimation.

Data is assumed to be from a QTL mapping family with DNA markers genotyped along the genome. The QTL mapping problem is represented as a model selection problem, where each model is a linear regression of the trait on a selected set of marker values. The main function bicreg.qtl() is based on the S function bicreg()— posterior probabilities for models are approximated from the BIC criterion, calculated for each model in a search of model space using leaps or regsubsets. Additionally, we allow for prior probabilities based on expected numbers of QTL per genome and options to control the size of models considered, and to allow for selectivly genotyping from the tails of the phenotypic distribution. Missing values are estimated by multiple imputation, and estimates of marker effects can be obtained conditional on selection or unconditional and free of selection bias.  The method relies on 3 approximations: (1.) QTL configuration is represented approximately by configurations with QTL located at marker positions; (2.) Posterior probabilities are given approximately in terms of the BIC criterion; and (3.) The distribution of missing marker values is approximated by multiple imputation, sampling from the distribution of missing values conditional on non-missing values. We have found these are good approximations provided (1.) the marker spacing is reasonable (less than 30cM); (2.) the sample size is 100 or more for fully genotyped populations; and (3.) around 10 imputations are used and the effect of any given QTL on the trait is not large. Due to limits on the number of markers that can be considered simultaneously the method is generally applied separately to each chromosome or could be iteratively applied to sets of chromosomes using fixed sets of predictors from other chromsomes when analysing a given chromosome.",leaps,,,,1.0-2,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],

BioGeoBEARS,BioGeography with Bayesian (and Likelihood) Evolutionary Analysis in R Scripts,"BioGeoBEARS allows probabilistic inference of both historical biogeography (ancestral geographic ranges on a phylogeny) as well as comparison of different models of range evolution.  It reproduces the model available in LAGRANGE (Ree and Smith 2008), as well as making available numerous additional models. For example, LAGRANGE as typically run has two free parameters, d (dispersal rate, i.e. the rate of range addition along a phylogenetic branch) and e (extinction rate, really the rate of local range loss along a phylogenetic branch). LAGRANGE also has a fixed cladogenic model which gives equal probability to a number of allowed range inheritance events, e.g.: (1) vicariance, (2) a new species starts in a subset of the ancestral range, (3) the ancestral range is copied to both species; in all cases, at least one species must have a starting range of size 1.  LAGRANGE assigns equal probability to each of these events, and zero probability to other events.  BioGeoBEARS adds an additional cladogenic event: founder-event speciation (the new species jumps to a range outside of the ancestral range), and also allows the relative weighting of the different sorts of events to be made into free parameters, allowing optimization and standard model choice procedures to pick the best model. The relative probability of different descendent range sizes is also parameterized and thus can also be specified or estimated.  The flexibility available in BioGeoBEARS also enables the natural incorporation of (1) imperfect detection of geographic ranges in the tips, and (2) inclusion of fossil geographic range data, when the fossils are tips on the phylogeny. Bayesian analysis has been implemented through use of the ""LaplacesDemon"" package, however this package is now maintained off of CRAN, so its usage is not formally included in BioGeoBEARS at the current time.

bit,A class for vectors of 1-bit booleans,"bitmapped vectors of booleans (no NAs), coercion from and to logicals, integers and integer subscripts; fast boolean operators and fast summary statistics. With 'bit' vectors you can store true binary booleans {FALSE,TRUE} at the expense of 1 bit only, on a 32 bit architecture this means factor 32 less RAM and ~ factor 32 more speed on boolean operations. Due to overhead of R calls, actual speed gain depends on the size of the vector: expect gains for vectors of size > 10000 elements. Even for one-time boolean operations it can pay-off to convert to bit, the pay-off is obvious, when such components are used more than once. Reading from and writing to bit is approximately as fast as accessing standard logicals - mostly due to R's time for memory allocation. The package allows to work with pre-allocated memory for return values by calling .Call() directly: when evaluating the speed of C-access with pre-allocated vector memory, coping from bit to logical requires only 70% of the time for copying from logical to logical; and copying from logical to bit comes at a performance penalty of 150%. the package now contains further classes for representing logical selections: 'bitwhich' for very skewed selections and 'ri' for selecting ranges of values for chunked processing.

The full model contains five parameters: the overall mean, the overall variance, the hybrid vigor, the hybrid variation and the proportion of heritability. We report four different models. All fix the heritability to equal contributions from each parent. Model 1 fixes the hybrid vigor and burst of variation at formation at 1 and 0; respectively. Model 2 fixes the hybrid vigor at 1 but allow the burst of variation at formation to vary; model 3 allows hybrid vigor to vary but fixes burst of variation at origin; and model 4 allows both to vary.

Expressions available for an arbitrary copula include the diagonal of a copula, the survival copula, the dual of a copula, and co-copula. Levels curves, such as for drawing, are available, through inverses of copulas. Sections (horizontal and vertical) and derivatives of these sections are supported. The numerical derivative for the derivative of a copula is provided as are inverses of these the numerical derivatives. Inverses of copula derivatives are important for random variate generation, which is provided using the conditional distribution method and the derivative of a copula. Composition of a single copula for two external parameters, composition of two copulas through use of two external parameters, and the composition of two copulas through the use of four external parameters is provided.  Composite copula random variates can be generated—compositions generally yield asymmetric copulas. A data set is provided that contains darts thrown at the L-comoment space of a Plackett-Plackett composited copula; these data might be used for experimental copula estimation by the method of L-comoments. Measures of association through concordance include Kendall Tau, Spearman Rho, Gini Gamma, and Blomqvist Beta. Schweizer-Wolff Sigma is provided as a measure of dependency in contrast to the concordance measures. Upper- and lower-tail dependence is computed by numerical limit convergence.

cudaBayesreg,CUDA Parallel Implementation of a Bayesian Multilevel Model for fMRI Data Analysis,"Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a software platform for massively parallel high-performance computing on NVIDIA GPUs. This package provides a CUDA implementation of a Bayesian multilevel model for the analysis of brain fMRI data. A fMRI data set consists of time series of volume data in 4D space. Typically, volumes are collected as slices of 64 x 64 voxels. Analysis of fMRI data often relies on fitting linear regression models at each voxel of the brain. The volume of the data to be processed, and the type of statistical analysis to perform in fMRI analysis, call for high-performance computing strategies. In this package, the CUDA programming model uses a separate thread for fitting a linear regression model at each voxel in parallel. The global statistical model implements a Gibbs Sampler for hierarchical linear models with a normal prior. This model has been proposed by Rossi, Allenby and McCulloch in ‘Bayesian Statistics and Marketing’, Chapter 3, and is referred to as ‘rhierLinearModel’ in the R-package bayesm. A notebook equipped with a NVIDIA ‘GeForce 8400M GS’ card having Compute Capability 1.1 has been used in the tests.

Digiroo2,An application programming interface for generating null models of social contacts based on individuals' space use,"Digiroo2 is an R package developed by researchers at the University of Queensland to investigate association patterns and social structure in wild animal populations. Proximity between individuals is generally considered to be an appropriate proxy for associations and pairwise association indices are the most widely used technique for analysing animal social structure. However, little attention is given to identifying how patterns of spatial overlap affect these association patterns. For example, do individuals associate randomly with others with whom they share home ranges, or do some individuals go out of their way to associate with or avoid particular individuals? This program builds a null model of random associations based on an individual's space use determined using home range methodologies. Random points may be generated within a specified home range contour or according to the Utilization Distribution (UD). Expected associations of individuals are extracted based on probability of occurrence and the proximity between home range weighted random points. Association matrices can be generated from multiple permutations for analysis using SOCPROG 2.4 (Whitehead 2009) to create 'expected' pairwise half-weight association indices (HWIs). These may be compared with the 'observed' HWIs from field observations to reveal whether pairs of animals associate more (= attraction) or less (= avoidance) than expected by chance.","R (≥ 2.14.0), maptools, spatstat, spdep","adehabitatHR, raster",,,0.6,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],

Moreover, for each random subset, the best set of features in terms of global error is returned. They are useful for applying Bolasso, the alternative feature selection method that recommends the intersection of features subsets.","lars, rms",,,,1.3,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],

ff,memory-efficient storage of large data on disk and fast access functions,"The ff package provides data structures that are stored on disk but behave (almost) as if they were in RAM by transparently mapping only a section (pagesize) in main memory - the effective virtual memory consumption per ff object. ff supports R's standard atomic data types 'double', 'logical', 'raw' and 'integer' and non-standard atomic types boolean (1 bit), quad (2 bit unsigned), nibble (4 bit unsigned), byte (1 byte signed with NAs), ubyte (1 byte unsigned), short (2 byte signed with NAs), ushort (2 byte unsigned), single (4 byte float with NAs). For example 'quad' allows efficient storage of genomic data as an 'A','T','G','C' factor. The unsigned types support 'circular' arithmetic. There is also support for close-to-atomic types 'factor', 'ordered', 'POSIXct', 'Date' and custom close-to-atomic types. ff not only has native C-support for vectors, matrices and arrays with flexible dimorder (major column-order, major row-order and generalizations for arrays). There is also a ffdf class not unlike data.frames and import/export filters for csv files. ff objects store raw data in binary flat files in native encoding, and complement this with metadata stored in R as physical and virtual attributes. ff objects have well-defined hybrid copying semantics, which gives rise to certain performance improvements through virtualization. ff objects can be stored and reopened across R sessions. ff files can be shared by multiple ff R objects (using different data en/de-coding schemes) in the same process or from multiple R processes to exploit parallelism. A wide choice of finalizer options allows to work with 'permanent' files as well as creating/removing 'temporary' ff files completely transparent to the user. On certain OS/Filesystem combinations, creating the ff files works without notable delay thanks to using sparse file allocation. Several access optimization techniques such as Hybrid Index Preprocessing and Virtualization are implemented to achieve good performance even with large datasets, for example virtual matrix transpose without touching a single byte on disk. Further, to reduce disk I/O, 'logicals' and non-standard data types get stored native and compact on binary flat files i.e. logicals take up exactly 2 bits to represent TRUE, FALSE and NA. Beyond basic access functions, the ff package also provides compatibility functions that facilitate writing code for ff and ram objects and support for batch processing on ff objects (e.g. as.ram, as.ff, ffapply). ff interfaces closely with functionality from package 'bit': chunked looping, fast bit operations and coercions between different objects that can store subscript information ('bit', 'bitwhich', ff 'boolean', ri range index, hi hybrid index). This allows to work interactively with selections of large datasets and quickly modify selection criteria. Further high-performance enhancements can be made available upon request.","R (≥ 2.10.1), bit (≥ 1.1-12), utils",biglm,,HighPerformanceComputing,2.2-13,GPL-2 | file LICENSE,

FRBSs are also known as fuzzy inference systems and fuzzy models. During the modeling of an FRBS, there are two important steps that need to be conducted: structure identification and parameter estimation. Nowadays, there exists a wide variety of algorithms to generate fuzzy IF-THEN rules automatically from numerical data, covering both steps.

The term elemental derives from the fact that each function is aimed at construction of graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental questions that drive the particular anova methods. The two main functions are granova.1w (a graphic for one way anova) and granova.2w (a corresponding graphic for two way anova). These functions were written to display data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes (however, very large data sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For these two functions a specialized approach is used to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are displayed. The result is that the graphics use straight lines, and when appropriate flat surfaces, to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect tests in anova. The graphic results are complementary to standard summary tables for these two basic kinds of analysis of variance; numerical summary results of analyses are also provided as side effects. Two additional functions are granova.ds (for comparing two dependent samples), and granova.contr (which provides graphic displays for a priori contrasts). All functions provide relevant numerical results to supplement the graphic displays of anova data. The graphics based on these functions should be especially helpful for learning how the methods have been applied to answer the question(s) posed. This means they can be particularly helpful for students and non-statistician analysts. But these methods should be quite generally helpful for work-a-day applications of all kinds, as they can help to identify outliers, clusters or patterns, as well as highlight the role of non-linear transformations of data. In the case of granova.1w and granova.ds especially, several arguments are provided to facilitate flexibility in the construction of graphics that accommodate diverse features of data, according to their corresponding display requirements.

granovaGG,Graphical Analysis of Variance Using ggplot2,"This collection of functions in granovaGG provides what we call elemental graphics for display of anova results. The term elemental derives from the fact that each function is aimed at construction of graphical displays that afford direct visualizations of data with respect to the fundamental questions that drive the particular anova methods. This package represents a modification of the original granova package; the key change is to use ggplot2, Hadley Wickham's package based on Grammar of Graphics concepts (due to Wilkinson). The main function is granovagg.1w (a graphic for one way anova); two other functions (granovagg.ds and granovagg.contr) are to construct graphics for dependent sample analyses and contrast-based analyses respectively. (The function granova.2w, which entails dynamic displays of data, is not currently part of granovaGG.) The granovaGG functions are to display data for any number of groups, regardless of their sizes (however, very large data sets or numbers of groups can be problematic). For granovagg.1w a specialized approach is used to construct data-based contrast vectors for which anova data are displayed. The result is that the graphics use a straight line to facilitate clear interpretations while being faithful to the standard effect test in anova. The graphic results are complementary to standard summary tables; indeed, numerical summary statistics are provided as side effects of the graphic constructions. granovagg.ds and granovagg.contr provide graphic displays and numerical outputs for a dependent sample and contrast-based analyses. The graphics based on these functions can be especially helpful for learning how the respective methods work to answer the basic question(s) that drive the analyses. This means they can be particularly helpful for students and non-statistician analysts.

HDMD,Statistical Analysis Tools for High Dimension Molecular Data (HDMD),"High Dimensional Molecular Data (HDMD) typically have many more variables or dimensions than observations or replicates (D>>N).  This can cause many statistical procedures to fail, become intractable, or produce misleading results.  This package provides several tools to reduce dimensionality and analyze biological data for meaningful interpretation of results. Factor Analysis (FA), Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) are frequently used multivariate techniques.  However, PCA methods prcomp and princomp do not reflect the proportion of total variation of each principal component.  Loadings.variation displays the relative and cumulative contribution of variation for each component by accounting for all variability in data. When D>>N, the maximum likelihood method cannot be applied in FA and the the principal axes method must be used instead, as in factor.pa of the psych package. The factor.pa.ginv function in this package further allows for a singular covariance matrix by applying a general inverse method to estimate factor scores. Moreover, factor.pa.ginv removes and warns of any variables that are constant, which would otherwise create an invalid covariance matrix. Promax.only further allows users to define rotation parameters during factor estimation.  Similar to the Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance estimates the relationship among groups.  pairwise.mahalanobis computes all such pairwise Mahalanobis distances among groups and is useful for quantifying the separation of groups in DA. Genetic sequences are composed of discrete alphabetic characters, which makes estimates of variability difficult.  MolecularEntropy and MolecularMI calculate the entropy and mutual information to estimate variability and covariability, respectively, of DNA or Amino Acid sequences.  Functional grouping of amino acids (Atchley et al 1999) is also available for entropy and mutual information estimation.  Mutual information values can be normalized by NMI to account for the background distribution arising from the stochastic pairing of independent, random sites. Alternatively, discrete alphabetic sequences can be transformed into biologically informative metrics to be used in various multivariate procedures.

huge,High-dimensional Undirected Graph Estimation,"The package ""huge"" provides a general framework for high-dimensional undirected graph estimation. It integrates data preprocessing, neighborhood screening, graph estimation, and model selection techniques into a pipeline. In preprocessing stage, the nonparanormal(npn) transformation is applied to help relax the normality assumption. In the graph estimation stage, the graph structure is estimated by Meinshausen-Buhlmann graph estimation or the graphical lasso, and both methods can be further accelerated by the lossy screening rule preselecting the neighborhood of each variable by correlation thresholding. We target on high-dimensional data analysis usually d >> n, and the computation is memory-optimized using the sparse matrix output. We also provide a computationally efficient approach, correlation thresholding graph estimation. Three regularization/thresholding parameter selection methods are included in this package: (1)stability approach for regularization selection (2) rotation information criterion (3) extended Bayesian information criterion which is only available for the graphical lasso.","R (≥ 3.0.0), Matrix, lattice, igraph, MASS",,,,1.2.6,GPL-2,

icaOcularCorrection,Independent Components Analysis (ICA) based artifact correction,"Removes eye-movement and other types of known (i.e., recorded) or unknown (i.e., not recorded) artifacts using the fastICA package. The correction method proposed in this package is largely based on the method described in on Flexer, Bauer, Pripfl, and Dorffner (2005). The process of correcting electro- and magneto-encephalographic data (EEG/MEG) begins by running function “icac”, which first performs independent components analysis (ICA) to decompose the data frame into independent components (ICs) using function “fastICA” from the package of the same name. It then calculates for each trial the correlation between each IC and each one of the noise signals – there can be one or more, e.g., vertical and horizontal electro-oculograms (VEOG and HEOG), electro-myograms (EMG), electro-cardiograms (ECG), galvanic skin responses (GSR), and other noise signals. Subsequently, portions of an IC corresponding to trials at which the correlation between it and a noise signal was at or above threshold (set to 0.4 by default; Flexer et al., 2005, p. 1001) are zeroed-out in the source matrix, “S”. The user can then identify which ICs correlate with the noise signals the most by looking at the summary of the “icac” object (using function “summary.icac”), the scalp topography of the ICs (using function “topo_ic”), the time courses of the ICs (using functions “plot_tric” and “plot_nic”), and other diagnostic plots. Once these ICs have been identified, they can be completely zeroed-out using function “update.icac” and the resulting correction checked using functions “plot_avgba” and “plot_trba”. Some worked-out examples with R code are provided in the package vignette.","fastICA, mgcv",wavethresh,,,3.0.0,GPL-2,

knitr,A general-purpose package for dynamic report generation in R,"This package provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R, which can be used to deal with any type of (plain text) files, including Sweave, HTML, Markdown, reStructuredText and AsciiDoc. The patterns of code chunks and inline R expressions can be customized. R code is evaluated as if it were copied and pasted in an R terminal thanks to the evaluate package (e.g. we do not need to explicitly print() plots from ggplot2 or lattice). R code can be reformatted by the formatR package so that long lines are automatically wrapped, with indent and spaces being added, and comments being preserved. A simple caching mechanism is provided to cache results from computations for the first time and the computations will be skipped the next time. Almost all common graphics devices, including those in base R and add-on packages like Cairo, cairoDevice and tikzDevice, are built-in with this package and it is straightforward to switch between devices without writing any special functions. The width and height as well as alignment of plots in the output document can be specified in chunk options (the size of plots for graphics devices is still supported as usual). Multiple plots can be recorded in a single code chunk, and it is also allowed to rearrange plots to the end of a chunk or just keep the last plot. Warnings, messages and errors are written in the output document by default (can be turned off). Currently LaTeX, HTML, Markdown and reST are supported, and other output formats can be supported by hook functions. The large collection of hooks in this package makes it possible for the user to control almost everything in the R code input and output. Hooks can be used either to format the output or to run a specified R code fragment before or after a code chunk. The language in code chunks is not restricted to R only (there is simple support to Python and Awk, etc).

The covariance model for this method can approximate the Matern covariance family but also allows for a multi-resolution model and supports efficient computation of the profile likelihood for estimating covariance parameters. This is accomplished through compactly supported basis functions and a Markov random field model for the basis coefficients. These features lead to sparse matrices for the computations. One benefit of this approach is the facilty to do unconditional and conditional simulation of the field for large numbers of arbitrary points. There is also the flexibility for estimating nonstationary covariances.

lmomco,"L-moments, Censored L-moments, Trimmed L-moments, L-comoments, and Many Distributions","The package is a comparatively comprehensive implementation of the theory of L-moments. L-moment, probability-weighted moment (PWM), and parameter estimation for numerous familiar and not-so-familiar distributions are provided. L-moment estimate for the same distributions are provided. L-moments are analogous to product moments; however, L-moments have many advantages including unbiasedness, robustness, and consistency. L-moments can outperform maximum likelihood for small to moderate samples. The package originally was originally oriented around circa 1996-FORTRAN algorithms by Hosking, and the nomenclature parallels that of Hosking. The Hosking algorithms later became available in the lmom package. However, vast extensions, components, concepts, more distributions, L-moment curiosities, and research topics are added. Such extensions the Sen weighted mean, Gini mean difference, plotting positions, and conditional probability adjustments. L-moment ratio diagrams are supported. L-moment support for right-tail and left-tail censoring by known or unknown censoring threshold and also by indicator variable. Asymmetric trimmed L-moments are supported as are numerical integration to dynamically compute trajectories of select TL-moment ratios for the construction of TL-moment ratio diagrams. L-moments have multi-variate analogs; the sample L-comoments are implemented and might have considerable application with copulas because L-comoments measure asymmetric association and higher comoments or comovements of variables. Support exists for exact analytical boot-strap estimates of order statistics, L-moments, and variances-covariances of L-moments. The Harri-Coble Tau34-squared Test for Normality using sample L-skew and L-kurtosis is available. Support for the following distributions, with moment type shown as ""L"" (L-moments) or ""TL"" (trimmed L-moments) and additional support for right-tail censoring ([RC]) include, is available: Asymmetric Exponential Power (L), Cauchy (TL), Eta-Mu (L), Exponential (L), Gamma (L), Generalized Extreme Value (L), Generalized Lambda (L & TL), Generalized Logistic (L), Generalized Normal (L), Generalized Pareto (L[RC] & TL), Govindarajulu (L), Gumbel (L), Kappa (L), Kappa-Mu (L), Kumaraswamy (L), Laplace (L), Normal (L), 3-parameter log-Normal (L), Pearson Type III (L), Rayleigh (L), Reverse Gumbel (L[RC]), Rice/Rician (L), Slash (TL), 3-parameter Student T (L), Truncated Exponential (L), Wakeby (L), and Weibull (L).","R (≥ 2.10.0), utils","copBasic, Lmoments",,Distributions,2.0.1,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL],

MNP,R Package for Fitting the Multinomial Probit Model,"MNP is a publicly available R package that fits the Bayesian multinomial probit model via Markov chain Monte Carlo. The multinomial probit model is often used to analyze the discrete choices made by individuals recorded in survey data. Examples where the multinomial probit model may be useful include the analysis of product choice by consumers in market research and the analysis of candidate or party choice by voters in electoral studies.  The MNP software can also fit the model with different choice sets for each individual, and complete or partial individual choice orderings of the available alternatives from the choice set. The estimation is based on the efficient marginal data augmentation algorithm that is developed by Imai and van Dyk (2005). “A Bayesian Analysis of the Multinomial Probit Model Using the Data Augmentation,” Journal of Econometrics, Vol. 124, No. 2 (February), pp. 311-334.

The second method approximates the latter approach by using only a subset of I(all) and is therefore computationally much more efficient, but asymptotically equivalent. Omitting the additive correction term Gamma in either method offers another two approaches which are more powerful on small scales and less powerful on large scales, however, not asymptotically minimax optimal anymore. Finally, the block procedure is a compromise between adding Gamma or not, having intermediate power properties.

(a) For the multivariate linear time series analysis, the package performs model specification, estimation, model checking, and prediction for many widely used models, including vector AR models, vector MA models, vector ARMA models, seasonal vector ARMA models, VAR models with exogenous variables, multivariate regression models with time series errors, augmented VAR models, and Error-correction VAR models for co-integrated time series. For model specification, the package performs structural specification to overcome the difficulties of identifiability of VARMA models. The methods used for structural specification include Kronecker indices and Scalar Component Models.  (b) For multivariate volatility modeling, the MTS package handles several commonly used models, including multivariate exponentially weighted moving-average volatility, Cholesky decomposition volatility models, dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models, copula-based volatility models, and low-dimensional BEKK models. The package also considers multiple tests for conditional heteroscedasticity, including rank-based statistics.  (c) Finally, the MTS package also performs forecasting using diffusion index, transfer function analysis, Bayesian estimation of VAR models, and multivariate time series analysis with missing values.Users can also use the package to simulate VARMA models, to compute impulse response functions of a fitted VARMA model, and to calculate theoretical cross-covariance matrices of a given VARMA model.",,,"Rcpp, fGarch, mvtnorm",TimeSeries,0.32,Artistic License 2.0,

Traced neurons can be imported from and written to SWC and Amira LineSet and SkeletonGraph formats. These data can then be visualised in 3D via rgl, manipulated including applying calculated registrations, e.g. using the CMTK registration suite, and analysed.

Commands are simple to follow and designed to work with R objects to integrate into existing workflows. The output produces text fields and weblinks to more information for items such as: gene descriptions, nucleotide positions, OMIM, pathways, phenotypes, and lists of interacting and neighboring genes. Annotation can then be used in R for further analysis, or the objects can be customized for use in spreadsheet programs or web browsers. The NCBI2R package was designed to allow those performing genome analysis to produce output that could easily be understood by a person not familiar with R.

Release 1.2 (2005-01-24) adds better support for character variables, and miscellaneous bug fixes.  Release 1.3 (2005-03-27) is for miscellaneous bug fixes, and improves the documentation.  Release 1.4 (2005-06-27) improves the efficiency, and adds small bug fixes. Release 1.5 (2006-02-27) adds support for byte variables, plus small bug fixes. Release 1.6 (2006-06-19) adds various bug fixes, plus support for making dimensions WITHOUT dimvars (coordinate variables), although I think this is a bad idea in general.  ALSO, the default behavior for put.var.ncdf with unlimited variables and NO specified start and count parameters has changed!  Before, the default was to append to the end of the existing variable.  Now, the default is to assume a start of 1 along each dimension, and a count of the current length of each dimension.  This really can be ambiguous when using an unlimited dimension. I always specify both start and count when writing to a variable with an unlimited dimension, and suggest you do as well.

PubBias,"Performs simulation study to look for publication bias, using a technique described by Ioannidis and Trikalinos; Clin Trials. 2007;4(3):245-53","I adapted a method designed by Ioannidis and Trikalinos, which compares the observed number of positive studies in a meta-analysis with the expected number, if the summary measure of effect, averaged over the individual studies, were assumed true. Excess in the observed number of positive studies, compared to the expected, is taken as evidence of publication bias. The observed number of positive studies, at a given level for statistical significance, is calculated by applying Fisher's exact test to the reported 2x2 table data of each constituent study, doubling the Fisher one-sided P-value to make a two-sided test. The corresponding expected number of positive studies was obtained by summing the statistical powers of each study. The statistical power depended on a given measure of effect which, here, was the pooled odds ratio of the meta-analysis was used. By simulating each constituent study, with the given odds ratio, and the same number of treated and non-treated as in the real study, the power of the study is estimated as the proportion of simulated studies that are positive, again by a Fisher's exact test. The simulated number of events in the treated and untreated groups was done with binomial sampling. In the untreated group, the binomial proportion was the percentage of actual events reported in the study and, in the treated group, the binomial sampling proportion was the untreated percentage multiplied by the risk ratio which was derived from the assumed common odds ratio. The statistical significance for judging a positive study may be varied and large differences between expected and observed number of positive studies around the level of 0.05 significance constitutes evidence of publication bias. The difference between the observed and expected is tested by chi-square. A chi-square test P-value for the difference below 0.05 is suggestive of publication bias, however, a less stringent level of 0.1 is often used in studies of publication bias as the number of published studies is usually small.","rmeta, R.utils",,,MetaAnalysis,1.0,GPL-3,

Culture growth is observed by time-lapse photography of solid agar plates inoculated with cultures in rectangular arrays.  Growth curves are constructed by analysing image series using Colonyzer image analysis software (http://research.ncl.ac.uk/colonyzer) which converts images to arrays of cell density estimates.  This R package is for a) fitting the generalised logistic model to potentially thousands of parallel growth curves, b) using inferred parameter values to calculate fitnesses for each culture and c) comparing fitnesses between QFA experiments with different genetic backgrounds or treatments to deduce interaction strengths. This package facilitates quantifying the fitness of thousands of independent microbial strains and tracking them throughout growth curve experiments.

The function is based on the idea that if real data are non-normal and the polychoric correlation matrix is needed to perform a Factor Analysis, then the Parallel Analysis method used to choose a non-random number of factors should also be based on randomly generated polychoric correlation matrices and not on Pearson correlation matrices.

Also in this version, the function is now able to manage supplied data.matrix in which variables representing factors (i.e., variables with ordered categories) are present and may cause an error when the Pearson correlation matrix is calculated. Version 1.1.2 simply has updated the function that calculates the polychoric correlation matrix due to changes in the psych() package. Version 1.1.3 tackles two problems signalled by users: 1) the possibility to make available the results of simulation for plotting them in other software. Now the random.polychor.pa will show, upon request, all the data used in the scree-plot. 2) The function polichoric() of the psych() package does not handle data matrices that include 0 as possible category and will cause the function to stop with error. So a check for the detection of the 0 code within the provided data.matrix is now added and will cause the random.polychor.pa function to stop with a warning message. In version 1.1.3.5 a paramether was added (diff.fact) in order to simulate random dataset with the same probability of observing each category for each variable as that observed in the provided (empirical) dataset. Finally the search for zeroes within the provided datafile was removed, so data with zeroes are now accepted.

Rcpp,Seamless R and C++ Integration,"The Rcpp package provides R functions as well as a C++ library which facilitate the integration of R and C++.  R data types (SEXP) are matched to C++ objects in a class hierarchy.  All R types are supported (vectors, functions, environment, etc ...)  and each type is mapped to a dedicated class. For example, numeric vectors are represented as instances of the Rcpp::NumericVector class, environments are represented as instances of Rcpp::Environment, functions are represented as Rcpp::Function, etc ... The ""Rcpp-introduction"" vignette provides a good entry point to Rcpp.  Conversion from C++ to R and back is driven by the templates Rcpp::wrap and Rcpp::as which are highly flexible and extensible, as documented in the ""Rcpp-extending"" vignette.  Rcpp also provides Rcpp modules, a framework that allows exposing C++ functions and classes to the R level. The ""Rcpp-modules"" vignette details the current set of features of Rcpp-modules.  Rcpp includes a concept called Rcpp sugar that brings many R functions into C++. Sugar takes advantage of lazy evaluation and expression templates to achieve great performance while exposing a syntax that is much nicer to use than the equivalent low-level loop code. The ""Rcpp-sugar"" vignette gives an overview of the feature.  Rcpp attributes provide a high-level syntax for declaring C++ functions as callable from R and automatically generating the code required to invoke them.  Attributes are intended to facilitate both interactive use of C++ within R sessions as well as to support R package development. Attributes are built on top of Rcpp modules and their implementation is based on previous work in the inline package.  Many examples are included, and around 891 unit tests in 430 unit test functions provide additional usage examples.  An earlier version of Rcpp, containing what we now call the 'classic Rcpp API' was written during 2005 and 2006 by Dominick Samperi.  This code has been factored out of Rcpp into the package RcppClassic, and it is still available for code relying on the older interface. New development should always use this Rcpp package instead.

Various matrix decompositions are provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.  A delayed evaluation approach is employed (during compile time) to combine several operations into one, and to reduce (or eliminate) the need for temporaries. This is accomplished through recursive templates and template meta-programming.  This library is useful if C++ has been decided as the language of choice (due to speed and/or integration capabilities), rather than another language.  The RcppArmadillo package includes the header files from the templated Armadillo library. Thus users do not need to install Armadillo itself in order to use RcppArmadillo.

A special characteristic of multi-stage selection is that candidates are evaluated in successive stages with increasing intensity and effort, and only a fraction of the superior candidates is selected and promoted to the next stage. For the optimum design of such selection programs, the selection gain plays a crucial role. It can be calculated by integration of a truncated multivariate normal (MVN) distribution. While mathematical formulas for calculating the selection gain and the variance among selected candidates were developed long time ago, solutions for numerical calculation were not available. This package can also be used for optimizing multi-stage selection programs for a given total budget and different costs of evaluating the candidates in each stage.","R (≥ 3.0.0), mvtnorm",,,,2.0.29,GPL-2,

One way to explicitly model publication bias is via selection models or weighted probability distributions. In this package we provide implementations of several parametric and nonparametric weight functions. The novelty in Rufibach (2011) is the proposal of a non-increasing variant of the nonparametric weight function of Dear & Begg (1992). The new approach potentially offers more insight in the selection process than other methods, but is more flexible than parametric approaches. To maximize the log-likelihood function proposed by Dear & Begg (1992) under a monotonicity constraint we use a differential evolution algorithm proposed by Ardia et al (2010a, b) and implemented in Mullen et al (2009). In addition, we offer a method to compute a confidence interval for the overall effect size theta, adjusted for selection bias as well as a function that computes the simulation-based p-value to assess the null hypothesis of no selection as described in Rufibach (2011, Section 6).",DEoptim (≥ 2.0-6),,,MetaAnalysis,1.0.6,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],

The design accounts for the issues that the efficacy of the treatment/vaccine groups may take time to accrue while the multiple treatment administrations/vaccinations are given; there is interest in assessing the durability of treatment efficacy over time; and group sequential monitoring of each treatment arm for potential harm, non-efficacy/efficacy futility, and high efficacy is warranted. The design divides the trial into two stages of time periods, where each treatment is first evaluated for efficacy in the first stage of follow-up, and, if and only if it shows significant treatment efficacy in stage one, it is evaluated for longer-term durability of efficacy in stage two. The package produces plots and tables describing operating characteristics of a specified design including an unconditional power for intention-to-treat and per-protocol/as-treated analyses; trial duration; probabilities of the different possible trial outcomes (e.g., stopping early for efficacy futility); unconditional power for comparing treatment efficacy; and distributions of numbers of endpoint events occurring after the treatments/vaccinations are given, useful as input parameters for the design of studies of the association of biomarkers with outcome (surrogate endpoint problem).

sigora,SIGNATURE OVERREPRESENTATION ANALYSIS,"SIGORA is a Pathway Analysis package. Pathway Analysis is the process of statistically linking observations on the molecular level to biological processes or pathways on the systems (cell, tissue, organ, organism) level. Traditional pathway analysis methods regard pathways as collections of single genes and treat all genes in a pathway as equally informative. This can lead to identification of spurious/misleading pathways as statistically significant, since many components are shared amongst pathways. SIGORA seeks to avoid this pitfall by focusing on genes or gene-pairs that are (as a combination) specific to a single pathway. In relying on such pathway gene-pair signatures (Pathway-GPSs), SIGORA inherently uses the status of other genes in the experimental context to identify the most relevant pathways. The current version allows for pathway analysis of human and mouse data sets and contains pre-computed Pathway-GPS data for pathways in the KEGG, PID_BIOCARTA, PID_NCI, INOH and REACTOME pathway repositories.

SimSeq,Nonparametric Simulation of RNA-Seq Data,"RNA-Seq analysis methods are often derived by relying on hypothetical parametric models for read counts that are not likely to be precisely satisfied in practice.  Methods are often tested by analyzing data that have been simulated according to the assumed model.  This testing strategy can result in an overly optimistic view of the performance of an RNA-Seq analysis method.  Rather than generating data from a questionable parametric model, the SimSeq package provides tools for simulating RNA-Seq data by subsampling from existing datasets.  The vector of read counts simulated for a given experimental unit has a joint distribution that closely matches the distribution of actual RNA-Seq data.  Users can control the proportion of genes simulated to be differentially expressed (DE) and can adjust the magnitude of differences for DE genes. SimSeq requires a matrix of RNA-Seq read counts with large sample sizes in at least two treatment groups. Although a full version of such a dataset is not distributed with the package, numerous candidate datasets are publicly available.",R (≥ 2.10.0),,"edgeR, fdrtool",,1.0.0,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],

The first technique addresses aleatory uncertainty in the system caused through inherent stochasticity, and determines the number of replicate runs necessary to generate a representative result. The second examines how robust a simulation is to parameter perturbation, through the use of a one-at-a-time parameter analysis technique. Thirdly, a latin hypercube based sensitivity analysis technique is included which can elucidate non-linear effects between parameters and indicate implications of epistemic uncertainty with reference to the system being modelled. Finally, a further sensitivity analysis technique, the extended Fourier Amplitude Sampling Test (eFAST) has been included to partition the variance in simulation results between input parameters, to determine the parameters which have a significant effect on simulation behaviour.

spate,Spatio-temporal modeling of large data using a spectral SPDE approach,"This is an R package for spatio-temporal modeling of large data sets. It provides tools for modeling of Gaussian processes in space and time defined through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE is solved in the spectral space, and after discretizing in time and space, a linear Gaussian state space model is obtained. When doing inference, the main computational difficulty consists in evaluating the likelihood and in sampling from the full conditional of the spectral coefficients, or equivalently, the latent space-time process. In comparison to the traditional approach of using a spatio-temporal covariance function, the spectral SPDE approach is computationally advantageous. This package aims at providing tools for two different modeling approaches. First, the SPDE based spatio-temporal model can be used as a component in a customized hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). The functions of the package then provide parameterizations of the process part of the model as well as computationally efficient algorithms needed for doing inference with the HBM. Alternatively, the adaptive MCMC algorithm implemented in the package can be used as an algorithm for doing inference without any additional modeling. The MCMC algorithm supports data that follow a Gaussian or a censored distribution with point mass at zero.

Models may involve dependence on covariates, interpoint interaction, cluster formation and dependence on marks. Models are fitted by maximum likelihood, logistic regression, minimum contrast, and composite likelihood methods. Fitted point process models can be simulated, automatically. Formal hypothesis tests of a fitted model are supported (likelihood ratio test, analysis of deviance, Monte Carlo tests) along with basic tools for model selection (stepwise, AIC). Tools for validating the fitted model include simulation envelopes, residuals, residual plots and Q-Q plots, leverage and influence diagnostics, partial residuals, and added variable plots.","R (≥ 3.0.2), stats, graphics, grDevices, utils","sm, maptools, gsl, locfit, spatial, rpanel, tkrplot, scatterplot3d, RandomFields (≥ 3.0.0)","mgcv, deldir (≥ 0.0-21), abind, tensor, polyclip (≥ 1.3-0)","Spatial, SpatioTemporal, Survival",1.37-0,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],

Note that the method takes into account the whole phylogeny, in particular it accounts for the ""pull of the present"" effect. Both models can take into account incomplete species sampling, as long as each species has the same probability of being sampled. For a given phylogeny on higher taxa (i.e. all but one species per taxa are mission), but where the number of species is known within each higher taxa, speciation and extinction rates can be estimated under model (1) (implemented as bd.shifts.optim with groups !=0). (ii) For a given phylogeny with sequentially sampled tips, e.g. a virus phylogeny, rates can be estimated under a model where rates vary across time using bdsky.stt.optim (extending bd.shifts.optim). Furthermore rates may vary as a function of host types using bdtypes.stt.lik (multitype branching process extending functions in R package diversitree).","ape, Matrix, subplex, TreeSim (≥ 1.6), deSolve",,,Phylogenetics,2.5,GPL-2,
TreeSim,Simulating trees under the birth-death model,"The package simulates phylogenetic trees where (i) all tips are sampled at one time point or (ii) tips are sampled sequentially through time. (i) For sampling at one time point, simulations are performed under a constant-rate birth-death process, conditioned on having a fixed number of final tips (sim.bd.taxa), or a fixed age (sim.bd.age), or a fixed age and number of tips (sim.bd.taxa.age). When conditioning on the number of final tips, the method allows for shifts in rates and mass extinction events during the birth-death process (sim.rateshift.taxa).sim.bd.age (and sim.rateshift.taxa without extinction) allow the speciation rate to change in a density-dependent way. The LTT plots of the simulations can be displayed using LTT.plot, LTT.plot.gen and LTT.average.root. TreeSim further samples appropriately trees with n final tips from a set of trees generated by the common sampling algorithm stopping when a fixed number m>>n of leaves is first reached (sim.gsa.taxa). This latter method is appropriate for m-tip trees generated under a big class of models (details in the sim.gsa.taxa man page). For incomplete phylogeny, the missing speciation events can be added through simulations (corsim). (ii) sim.rateshifts.taxa is generalized to sim.bdsky.stt for serially sampled trees, where the trees are conditioned on either the number of sampled tips or the age.

The speciation modes have all binary splits and are: (i) symmetric, where for every speciation event new waiting times until speciation and extinction are drawn for both daughter lineages; and (ii) asymmetric, where a speciation event results in one species with new waiting times, and another that carries the extinction time and age of its ancestor. Those two modes were inspired by allopatric and peripatric speciation respectively.Both models (symmetric and asymmetric) were created and implemented so that different processes (distributions) for speciation and extinction could be independently and explicitly specified.

WhatIf,WhatIf: Software for Evaluating Counterfactuals,"Inferences about counterfactuals are essential for prediction, answering what if questions, and estimating causal effects. However, when the counterfactuals posed are too far from the data at hand, conclusions drawn from well-specified statistical analyses become based largely on speculation hidden in convenient modeling assumptions that few would be willing to defend.  Unfortunately, standard statistical approaches assume the veracity of the model rather than revealing the degree of model-dependence, which makes this problem hard to detect.  WhatIf offers easy-to-apply methods to evaluate counterfactuals that do not require sensitivity testing over specified classes of models.  If an analysis fails the tests offered here, then we know that substantive inferences will be sensitive to at least some modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence, no matter what method of inference one chooses to use.  WhatIf implements the methods for evaluating counterfactuals discussed in Gary King and Langche Zeng, 2006, ""The Dangers of Extreme Counterfactuals,"" Political Analysis 14 (2); and Gary King and Langche Zeng, 2007, ""When Can History Be Our Guide?

XBRL,Extraction of business financial information from XBRL documents," XBRL is a package suited to extract business financial information from an Extensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) instance file and the associated collection of files that defines its Discoverable Taxonomy Set (DTS). These files are usually disseminated across different remote locations. XBRL documents employ many technologies defined by XML standards, such as XML Schema, Namespaces, XLink, and XPath, which make the extraction of information involved. The functions provided by this package address this complexity, returning data frames containing the enclosed information readily available to perform analyses. XBRL has been successfully tested in analyzing 10-K and 10-Q submissions from USA filing companies that are publicly available at the EDGAR system of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As published taxonomy files (such as ""http://xbrl.fasb.org/us-gaap/2013/elts/us-gaap-2013-01-31.xsd"") are immutable and are used by most filers, XBRL offers the option of downloading them only the first time they are referred, keeping a local cache copy that can be used from then on. This speeds-up the process, specially on slow connections. XBRL is not and does not aim to be (at least yet) a validating XBRL processor. XBRL is still a work in progress. As such, functions and produced data frames may change structure in future versions until stabilization.",,,Rcpp (≥ 0.10.4),,0.99.11,GPL-2 | GPL-3 [expanded from: GPL (≥ 2)],
